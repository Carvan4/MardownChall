## What I Love to Do

1. Watch Football
2. Be Outdoors
3. Go To The Gym




## [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.chiefs.com)

I grew up a little south of Kansas City, so I was raised a diehard Chiefs fan. 
As they have gotten better it's been easier to be a fan, but I also stayed a fan during the rough times. 
Hoping Mahomes can bring us back to the playoffs and make a run for the third straight SuperBowl appearance.

## [The Outdoors](https://stepoutside.org/article/10-breathtaking-views-in-the-great-outdoors/)

Being outdoors on a nice cool day is a form of mediation for me. 
I love fourwheeling, hiking, fishing, hunting, shooting in general, swimming, traveling, etc.
Depending on the season there are certain places I love and would die to be at.
The undestroyed part of the outdoors is just beautiful and mind blowing to look at.

## [Weight Room](https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/ct-weightlifting-as-meditation-20170207-story.html)

Being a college student and working as well brings a lot of stress and axiety.
There is a lot to worry about being a student, so I use the gym as a form of meditation.
It calms me down after a long day of work and homework.
